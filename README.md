# luke-voxel
Personal project in an attempt to make a Voxel Engine in C++/OpenGL, might be public if I need it for scholarships/entrances, won't be accepting public commits/feedback sorry. Feel free to fork or use for yourself, I wish to license this project under the CC0 license.
To compile, use the CMakeLists.txt file from this repo: https://github.com/meemknight/openglConfiguration/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt
Use W/A/S/D to move camera, use </, and >/. keys to cycle through how the project is rendered.
Use 1/2/3 to flip the render on the X/Y/Z axes respectively.
Use space to show the test render, which is a sphere.
When using the program to render from an image on your computer, use the commandline to launch it, and set the first argument as the file path, and the second as the size.
Download the code from the reupload folder, GitHub bugged out on my PC and I didn't know what to do.
