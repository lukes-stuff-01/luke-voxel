# luke-voxel
Personal project in an attempt to make a Voxel Engine in C++/OpenGL, might be public if I need it for scholarships/entrances, won't be accepting public commits/feedback sorry. Feel free to fork or use for yourself, I wish to license this project under the CC0 license.
To compile, use the CMakeLists.txt file from this repo: https://github.com/meemknight/openglConfiguration/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt
Use W/A/S/D to move camera, use </, and >/. keys to cycle through how the project is rendered.
Use 1/2/3 to flip the render on the X/Y/Z axes respectively.
Use space to show the test render, which is a sphere.
